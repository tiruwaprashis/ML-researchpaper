Research Background and Future Direction
#
This study was based on a machine learning model applied to a cybersecurity-related topic. Despite some challenges and fluctuations during the research process, I aim to further develop this work by incorporating a real-world dataset from Nepal, making the study more contextually relevant to Nepalâ€™s cybersecurity landscape.
